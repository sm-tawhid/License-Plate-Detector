# AI Usage Log

## Understanding Tier Requirements
I used AI to help clarify the differences between Tier 1 and Tier 2 projects.  
This helped me confirm that License Plate Detection falls under Tier 1.  
I wrote the proposal and project plan myself.

## Package Clarification
I asked AI which core Python packages YOLOv8 depends on so I could confirm what to include in `requirements.txt`.  
I added the packages manually and installed them on my own.

## Dataset Download Explanation
I used AI only to understand how the Roboflow API download process works.  
AI explained the purpose of the API key and version call.  
I added the final dataset code to the notebook myself.

## Troubleshooting Missing Metrics Output
When `model.val()` did not show metrics automatically, I asked AI why.  
AI explained that YOLO does not print metrics unless prompted.  
I wrote and executed the print commands myself.

## General Learning Support
I used AI as a reference for brief explanations of some computer vision concepts, such as what mAP means.  
No code or results were generated by AI.  
All training, evaluation, predictions, and documentation were completed manually by me.
